# WebRTC-App
This is  an update to the raw version of a webrtc project  with improvments like conference call and few changes. Lot more fundamental interface based and  code based changes can be done.
(.) WebRTC is an cutting-edge technology used by many organisations and is highly effective in producing applications rich in video , audio and data transfer abilities.

This project uses SIP.js as a layer to protect app from cross browser usage and makes it easier to write code at upper level.
ONSIP server is used in this project for signalling, This can also be done by FREESWITCH or Asterisk as signalling is not defined in WebRTC API's.
You have to set up the database accordingly for login and signup,rest is all client side.

Many interface based ( html,css) modifications are still required in addition to changes in code.
All types of CONTRIBUTIONS are welcomed!.
